It is an infinite sequence of natural numbers

* Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
  * fib(0) = 0
  * fib(1) = 1
  * fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) for n>=2

Write a function to generate the Fibonacci number for the nth position.

Example: int Fibonacci(int n)

The first Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
